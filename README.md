# HABITS CONTROLLER
Habit controller is a very simple application for controlling your habits. 
Write the name of the habit in the input you'd like to track and click the `Go!` button. These actions make the calendar rendered. Tick the checkbox next to the data, to mark the success. Your habit state will be saved in the browser, so the next time, when you enter the application, you' ll be able to choose one of the saved habits from the input's dropdown. Untrack the habit by clicking `Remove` button.
